Our first Open Meeting of the year saw a record number of people join us at The New Place! The cakes probably had something to do with it but for whatever reason you came, we were delighted to see you all and hope that you’ll be able to support us at meetings throughout the year with the same enthusiasm and great ideas you brought with you yesterday.
The format was a little different than usual with a short introduction followed by an ‘open’ style without too much of a rigid agenda. It needs tweaking a bit but we’re headed in the right direction.
The introduction talked about FOEPs’ role and strategy in applying for funding for park projects. Funds from Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and S106 are applied for through Eastville Neighbourhood Network  and  those chosen taken forward by councillors to an Area Committee who decide which projects will be funded. Following our recent consultation with park users, we submitted bids for improvements to play area and equipment, toilet and refreshments facilities. As there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our bids, an outline of other efforts to obtain funding (lottery, business and community funding organisations) was given. The committee are hard at work on researching and sourcing funds for park improvements. The work to attract funding is especially arduous and intricate in the current climate and we would warmly welcome any help from folk who have relevant experience in the process.
We were joined by organisers of Love Saves The Day (LSTD) who outlined some changes in the pipeline for this years’ festival:
Increase in visitor numbers from 20,000 to 25,000, approx 10% increase in site area (towards the M32) and additional stages. The reason given for the changes is the council decision to increase this years’ site fees by 50%. As expected, questions were asked about the impact of these changes . Local residents reiterated their concerns about ‘al fresco’ toilet behaviour off-site- including streets and gardens- and  lack of facilities around the perimeter of the site. LSTD listened to those concerns and are looking at ways to mitigate the behaviour including additional urinals in strategic locations.
FOEP have a good mutual relationship with the organisers and benefit significantly from the festival donation to funds-£7/8K- each year. We will continue to raise any concerns local residents may have and are confident they will be listened to. To add a further boost to our funds, we suggested LSTD might like to provide us with a foodie pitch inside the venue. They’re thinking about that one! In the meantime they’re happy to look at ways of promoting the park on their social media platforms.

# PARKWORK

Update on the invaluable work done by the team to keep the park looking good and news of opportunities coming soon to get involved. Recent tasks have included litter picking, tree care, footpath clearance and owl box construction. As well as regular weekday sessions, a new initiative to attract more volunteers sees the group in the park on Sunday mornings 10-12 beginning on 15th April. Among work planned is installing picnic bench and spring clean of the old pool. Please visit their Facebook page for more details on how to get involved.

# JUNIOR PARKRUN

A presentation marking the first year of this amazing story of children getting fit and having fun in our park on a weekend! Over 400 children have so far taken part. To be part of the experience as a runner or to offer help as a marshal, please visit their Facebook Page.
Ideas and suggestions flowed as the meeting progressed:
* We looked at ways to improve our communication and involvement with park users. As things stand, the Facebook group is the point of contact for many. Not everyone uses social media so we are going to widen the choice by revamping the website www.eastvillepark.org providing regular updates. We’ll also have a better presence in park noticeboards and develop our monthly Fishponds Voice article. Other suggestions we’re looking at are exposure on noticeboards in places like libraries and supermarkets locally. We are looking at finding someone who can be our e-communications manager- potentially a student internship from UWE?
* We’ve started work on a calendar of park events and activities which will give an overview at a glance of what’s happening throughout the year.
* The state of the shelter above the lake (a place of nefarious activity at times) led to suggestion that it should be demolished on the one hand and developed as something lovely- a butterfly house maybe?- on the other. A beautiful idea but worries about vandalism in that location.
* Plans were made to obtain some wild flower seeds and sow them at various park locations.
* An appeal to anglers to do their best to avoid leaving discarded fishing line and tackle around. Many of the waterfowl are bottom feeders and vulnerable to harm from hooks and line.
* The much criticised BCC plan to encourage advertising in parks was talked about and appropriately ridiculed. The consensus was that one of the main reasons for visiting parks was to escape from the ubiquitous presence of advertising in our lives. Despite ruling out large scale implementation of the scheme, BCC are planning to go ahead with ‘limited impact advertising’- lamp post stickers etc. Fears of mission creep?
* The potential uses for the disused  bowling green and associated areas were discussed and ideas put forward:
* A dog fun/agility show idea is being explored. Likely to be very well supported.
* Lots of support and enthusiasm for a community gardening project with an emphasis on progressive gardening ideas and less -abled access opportunities.
* We talked about organising some old favourite park activities- and some new ones too:
* Guided bat walks, Guided bird walks for beginners, photography walk and talks, moth trapping sessions.
* Orienteering bear hunt, Wildlife trail.

The runaway success of FOEP calendar this year has guaranteed it’s return for a second year! Ideas to improve included depicting a range of birds found in the park.
There has been something of an ‘arty’ feel to park life over the last few months with our duck feed art project and the setup of our linked FOEP ArtSpace Facebook page for park user artists to show their work. Some of that energy is flowing into other ideas of a creative sort. Plans are afoot:
An illustrated storybook taking us on a journey through the park and meeting well known- and sometimes ficticous- characters and features.
A variation on the theme of the National Trusts ’50 things to do before you’re eleven and three quarters’ which guarantees a messy adventure through the park and along the river.
An ‘I-Spy in my park’ with drawings representing park creatures and thingys. A great chance to re-create an almost forgotten icon from our childhood!
These are all being planned by really creative folk in our midst and will be so much fun to look forward to.

And finally:
* We talked about our plans to have a summer holidays activity day beside the lake which would be something of a mix of country fair and fete which will be aimed at promoting and celebrating everything the park means to us.
* We’ll have: (including suggestions made at this meeting)
* Pooh stick races, Raft races (build and launch), Artist and woodcarving demonstrations/workshops, Scribble and sketch sessions, forest school fun, bug hotels, findability sailing, bark rubbing, Vintage bicycles display, ArtSpace gallery, live music, bar-b-q  and other refreshments, rope swings, and anything else we can think of- and manage!
* Spread amongst the trees we hope to attract representatives from interest groups: Owls, otters, Bats, Birds, Anglers, Bristol Avon Rivers Trust, Avon Invasive Weeds, Parkwork,  ParkRun,  Photographers, Parks Dept and anyone else we can persuade! They’ll be there to inform, educate and generally behave themselves while we’re all having fun! 

Of course, we won’t be able to do everything we’d like to as a Friends Committee- there aren’t nearly enough of us , but as a Friends Group- together we can make a lot of this stuff happen. Just going by the enthusiasm we had at the meeting, it is clear that we have the ideas and the talents to make things work. Now we need everyone’s help to do it. We’ll also be looking at co-opting folk with skills that we currently lack to drive forward our ambitions.

Thank you to all of you who turned up and made such a wonderful contribution and to all Friends who continue to support and engage in many ways – we are nothing without you!
