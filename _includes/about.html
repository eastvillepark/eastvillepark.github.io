                    <p class="text-muted">Eastville Park is a large Victorian park with a range of facilities 2 miles north-east of Bristol city centre. It is a great place to relax surrounded by a spacious and diverse landscape. There is a large ornamental lake, tennis courts, bowling greens, children's play area, woodlands and wild flower meadows. It connects via the lovely Frome Valley Walkway, to Snuff Mills and Oldbury Court Estate. It is the reason why many people choose to live in Fishponds. </p>
